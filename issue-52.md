## Summary
Analyze the [Microsoft VS Code Repository](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode) to evaluate the current logging mechanisms and provide a detailed Level of Effort (LOE) for enhancing the logging functionality.

## Description
The goal of this task is to review the existing logging setup in the VS Code codebase and propose enhancements that improve debugging, diagnostics, and operational monitoring. Key deliverables include an assessment of the current implementation, recommendations for enhancements, and an estimated LOE to implement these changes.

## Objectives
1. **Repository Analysis**:
   - 📂 Explore the repository structure, especially areas related to logging.
   - ⚙️ Identify the current logging libraries/frameworks in use.
   - 🔎 Review the logging coverage and style used across modules.

2. **Enhancement Recommendations**:
   - 💡 Suggest potential enhancements, such as structured logging, log levels, or integration with external logging/monitoring services (e.g., ELK stack or Azure Monitor).
   - 🛠️ Address areas where logging can improve error tracing and debugging.

3. **Level of Effort (LOE)**:
   - ⏱️ Estimate the development effort required to implement the proposed enhancements.
   - ⚠️ Highlight any technical risks or dependencies.

## Acceptance Criteria
- ✅ Documentation outlining the current logging implementation.
- ✅ A list of recommended logging enhancements with justification.
- ✅ A detailed LOE report that breaks down the effort required for each recommendation.
